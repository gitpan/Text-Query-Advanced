NAME
    Text::Query::Advanced - Match text against Boolean expression

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Query::Advanced;
        
        # Constructor
        $query = Text::Query::Advanced->new([QSTRING] [OPTIONS]);

        # Methods
        $query->prepare(QSTRING [OPTIONS]);
        $query->match([TARGET] [OPTIONS]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an object that matches a string or list of
    strings against a Boolean query expression similar to an
    AltaVista "advanced query". Elements of the query expression may
    be regular expressions or literal text.

    Query expressions are compiled into an internal form (currently,
    a regular expression making use of most of the tricks listed in
    Recipe 6.17 of _The Perl Cookbook_) when a new object is created
    or the `prepare' method is called; they are not recompiled on
    each match.

    Query expressions consist of literal strings (or regexps) joined
    by the following operators, in order of precedence from lowest
    to highest:

    OR, |
    AND, &
    NEAR
    NOT, !
    Operator names are not case-sensitive. Note that if you want to
    use a `|' in a regexp, you need to backwhack it to keep it from
    being seen as a query operator. Sub-expressions may be quoted in
    single or double quotes to match "and," "or," or "not" literally
    and may be grouped in parentheses (`(, )') to alter the
    precedence of evaluation.

    A parenthesized sub-expression may also be concatenated with
    other sub- expressions to match sequences: `(Perl or Python)
    interpreter' would match either "Perl interpreter" or "Python
    interpreter". Concatenation has a precedence higher than NOT but
    lower than AND. Juxtaposition of simple words has the highest
    precedence of all.

INSTALLATION
    This module is pure Perl, so it can be simply copied into the 
    appropriate directory.
